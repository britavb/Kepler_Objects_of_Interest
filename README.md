# Kepler_Objects_of_Interest
Analysis of data from the first four years of the Kepler Space mission (primary mission)

The task in this project was to seperate those objects worth investigating further from those which look less promising. Telescope time is valuable and rare, especially at the large ones. Since the measurements are objective and in numbers this is a task machine learning is suited to.

This project was completed in mid-February 2021.
